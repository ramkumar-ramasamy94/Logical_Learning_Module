1) Using Scala, find the maximum profit when buying and selling a stock on the same day or on the previous day.
2) This approach works efficiently with a time complexity of 
𝑂(𝑛) where 𝑛
n is the number of days (i.e., the length of the prices array).
It works by capturing every increase in price, thereby ensuring maximum profit over multiple transactions.
This solution is optimal for the problem as it captures all opportunities for profit in a single pass through the array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
